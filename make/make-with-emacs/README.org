* About

This is a demonstration on how to use a special Makefile called
[[file:Makefile.emacs][=Makefile.emacs=]] which will contains commands to be executed through the =M-x
compile= command of Emacs defined through the [[file:.dir-locals.el][=.dir-locals.el=]] file.

From any file of the project, one can call the =M-x compile= to execute the
default target. With =C-u M-x compile=, one can choose the target to execute.
